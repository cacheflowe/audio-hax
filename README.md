# AudioHax
A generative audio/visual system

### About

I'm interested in building an audio/visual performance tool that generates audio and visual, with the ability to jam on the software in realtime with webmidi or keyboard controls. This is a simple proof-of-concept right now, but hopefully I/we can build this thing out. Each library helps us build generative .wav files, webaudio synths, and sequence them all together. Check out the current [demo](http://cacheflowe.github.io/audio-hax).

### Dependencies

I've hacked the original versions of these libraries to play with each other:

* [blip.js](http://jshanley.github.io/blip/)
* [jsfx](https://github.com/loov/jsfx)
* [litsynth](https://github.com/padenot/litsynth)
